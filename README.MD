# Census Bureau Data Classifier with FastAPI, CI/CD & GitHub Actions

## üìäProject Description:
This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a binary classification model trained on the Census Bureau dataset, aimed at predicting whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year. The model is an XGBoost classifier and it was optimized and validated for various age groups, providing insights into its performance across different life stages. This is an important aspect considering the model's potential use cases in real-world applications.

FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, is used to serve the trained model via a RESTful API. This enables end users to interact with the model in a simple and effective way. The API is deployed to a cloud-based platform, ensuring efficient resource utilization and scalability.

In addition to a focus on deployment, the project incorporates best practices for model management, performance monitoring, versioning, and explains each step in detail via a model card. A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, providing automated model testing, version control, and deployment.
