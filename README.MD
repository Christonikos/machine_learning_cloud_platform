# Census Bureau Data Classifier with FastAPI, CI/CD & GitHub Actions

## üìäProject Description:
This project demonstrates the development and deployment of a binary classification model trained on the Census Bureau dataset, aimed at predicting whether a person's income exceeds $50K per year. The model is an XGBoost classifier and it was optimized and validated for various age groups, providing insights into its performance across different life stages. This is an important aspect considering the model's potential use cases in real-world applications.

FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, is used to serve the trained model via a RESTful API. This enables end users to interact with the model in a simple and effective way. The API is deployed to a cloud-based platform, ensuring efficient resource utilization and scalability.

In addition to a focus on deployment, the project incorporates best practices for model management, performance monitoring, versioning, and explains each step in detail via a model card. A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions, providing automated model testing, version control, and deployment.

# Results

In this section, we present key findings and results from our model's performance evaluation.

The model performance was evaluated across different age groups to provide a thorough understanding of its reliability across various life stages. Age groups were defined as follows:

- '17-24: College Age / Early Career'
- '25-34: Early Adults / Young Professionals'
- '35-44: Midlife / Settled Adults'
- '45-54: Late Midlife'
- '55-64: Pre-Retirement'
- '65-90: Retirement Age'

Each age group represented a unique life stage, allowing for a nuanced analysis of the model's performance.

The evaluation metrics used included precision, recall, F-beta score, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. All these metrics provided a comprehensive picture of the model's overall performance and its ability to correctly predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50k per year.

The figure below summarizes the model's performance across these age groups.
