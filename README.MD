#**Census Bureau Data Classifier with FastAPI, CI/CD & GitHub Actions**

## ** üìä Project Description**:
This is a project focused on the integration, deployment, and management of machine learning models within a cloud-based environment using the FastAPI framework. The main objective is to streamline the process of deploying ML models, enabling seamless interaction between end-users and the prediction engine, while ensuring efficient resource utilization and scalability.

The project leverages FastAPI, a high-performance, Python web framework, to develop a RESTful API that serves as an interface for the ML model. This API is then deployed to a cloud application platform, which provides the necessary infrastructure and resources for hosting and scaling the application as needed.

In addition to simplifying the deployment process, the project also emphasizes best practices for model management, monitoring, and versioning. It demonstrates the use of modern tools and techniques for containerization, continuous integration, and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, ensuring that the ML model remains up-to-date and aligned with the latest data.
