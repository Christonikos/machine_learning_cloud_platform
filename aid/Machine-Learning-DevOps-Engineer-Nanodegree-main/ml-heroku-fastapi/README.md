## Deploying a Machine Learning Model on Heroku with FastAPI ##

## Project Overview ##
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model on publicly available Census Bureau data, to create unit tests to monitor the model performance on various slices of the data, to deploy the model using the FastAPI package and create API tests. Both the slice-validation and the API tests were incorporated into a CI/CD framework using GitHub Actions.
