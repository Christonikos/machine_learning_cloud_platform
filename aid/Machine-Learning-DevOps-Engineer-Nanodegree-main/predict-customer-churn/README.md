## Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code ##
*"Take a colleague's messy juypter notebook for building a customer churn prediction model and implement all of the clean code principles you have learned throughout the course!"*

The goal of the project was to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn by building a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested).
